# ⚔️ Tjostball – Easy Rules

## 1. Teams

- **2 teams**
- **12 players each** (instead of 27)

**Roles:**

- **2 Front Fighters** – block, wrestle, hold opponents
- **3 Heavy Hitters** – create space, can also carry the ball
- **1 Runner** – fast, usually gets the ball
- **6 Supporters** – flexible roles

## 2. Field

- Rectangle: **50 × 25 m**
- Each end has a **3 m wide goal**
- Field clearly marked (wooden stakes, ropes, walls)

## 3. Objective

- Carry or throw the ball into the opponent’s goal
- **Goal = 1 point**
- Ball goes over the goal → **½ point for the opponent**

## 4. Allowed Actions

- Pushing, wrestling, blocking, throwing

**Not allowed:**

- Hits to the head
- Kicks against players on the ground
- Attacks from behind

> If a player is on the ground → they are *“out of contact”* and ignored

## 5. Gameplay

- **Duration:** 2 × 15 minutes
- **Start:** Ball is thrown into the center
- Teams try to gain space
- Fights last briefly (**max. 5 seconds**), then the ball must continue moving

## 6. Passing

- The ball can:
    - be thrown over short distances
    - be handed off while running
- Long passes are inaccurate and risky → high **“chaos factor”**

## 7. Points & Victory

- The team with the most points after time wins
- **Tie:** golden attack
    - (first team to score a goal wins)
